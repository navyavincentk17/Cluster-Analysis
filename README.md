# Cluster-Analysis
Predicting the optimum number of cluster from the data. Here, I am using cluster analysis on Iris data set in Scikit learn. The data set consist of 150 samples which is taken from three species of flowers Iris-Setosa, Iris-Virginica, and Iris-Versicolor. Four featurs were measured from each sample includes the length and width of the sepals and petals.

This this project I have using K-means clustering method.

There are the steps for that,
Steps:
1. Import the data set
2. visualising 
3. Finding the optimum number of clusters
4. Applying K-Means clustering on the data
5. Visualising the clusters
